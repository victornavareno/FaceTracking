# Face Tracking APP using OpenCV and MediaPipe

An engaging game where the player must avoid randomly moving objects. The player’s movement is controlled by tracking their face in real-time using their computer’s camera.

## Technologies Used

### 1. **Pygame**

- Used for creating and managing the game window, rendering graphics, and handling game loops and events.

### 2. **OpenCV**

- Utilized for capturing video input from the webcam.
- Provides real-time video frame processing and preparation for facial recognition.

### 3. **MediaPipe**

- Used to detect and track facial landmarks (specifically the nose) in real-time.
- Provides efficient and accurate face landmark detection to control player movement based on webcam input.
